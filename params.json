How do we do it? First, we start with a network of the best known and most respected venues in the country. Gold’s Gym, LA Fitness, Planet Fitness, Bally Total Fitness, JCCs/YMCAs and numerous regional and local leaders all broadcast our network. \r\n\r\n### Grab Attention\r\nWe hold the attention of the members at the club by broadcasting a combination of entertainment content, relevant and timely fitness programming, advertisements and “news members can use” to get the most out of their membership.\r\n\r\n### Why Health Clubs?\r\nHealth club members are a desirable audience for local businesses since they outspend other groups of consumers in categories like restaurants, home improvement, retail, medical, insurance, automotive, financial services and many more. \r\n\r\nThe results is a unique, cost efficient and powerful communications medium that connects local businesses to customers and prospective customers who live and work in the community. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
